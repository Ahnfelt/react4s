    TODOs:
    - Implement Routing with type safe links
    - Think about components that emit no messages
    - Think about componentDidUpdate - it runs after render

    PROs:
    - Implements shouldComponentUpdate() correctly out of the box
    - No implicits
    - No macros
    - No hard-to-understand types
    - No postfix operators
    - No non-alpha-numeric identifiers (ie. no $<^-)

    Why this library?
    - Existing React-based libraries for scala felt "alien" to use.
    - They have lots of complicated types, macros and strangely named identifiers.
    - You had to memoize callbacks in order to get something as simple as an input field to work.
    - They are full of gotchas where you'd silently lose performance.
    This library is very simple to use, and the resulting code is easy to read and easy to get right.
    Most of all, it feels like you're writing a Scala code, rather than using some alien DSL for emitting React code.
